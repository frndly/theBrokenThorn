# theBrokenThorn
A practice website that I made for a D and D Inn that I randomly generated on donjon.  

The premise is a modern restaurant website with some extras.  The landing page will have a button that says "Roll for Initiative."  If you roll a 1 you get a 404 error, if you roll 2-10 you get the comicSans site, if you roll 11-19 you get the fancy website, and if you roll a 20 you get Rick Rolled (or something else, it doesn't really matter).  

The site itself is pretty simple, it's just three pages which I have included wire frames for below.

Keep in mind that these are for the "fancy" site, yours do not have to look like this and in fact I think it would be better if they didn't!  Do whatever you want, make it horrible if you feel like it hashtag yolo.
