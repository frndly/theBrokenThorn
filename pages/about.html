        <h4>
            The Broken Thorne was built hundreds of years ago by a mysterious man, of whom many legend hath been written.  The Inn was passed down through his lineage until it finally found its rest in the hands of Arfin, a friendly though fierce human woman.  <br><br>
            Arfin has dedicated her life to creating an environment where adventurers and townsfolk alike will find peace, comfort, and the occasional bar brawl. Arfin lives in the tower, a more recent addition to the historic building.<br><br>
            The Inn has a complete bunkhouse, plus two additional single rooms for patrons.  A long tavern runs the length of the building, and during the day it is lit solely from its large windows.  The menu is sparse but of great quality.
