# theBrokenThorn

 The premise is a modern restaurant website with some extras.  The landing page will have a button that says "Roll for Initiative."  If you roll a 1 you get a 404 error, if you roll 2-10 you get the comicSans site, if you roll 11-19 you get the fancy website, and if you roll a 20 you get Rick Rolled (or something else, it doesn't really matter).  
 
 The site itself is pretty simple, it's just three pages which I have included wire frames for below.
 
 Keep in mind that these are for the "fancy" site, yours do not have to look like this and in fact I think it would be better if they didn't!  Do whatever you want, make it horrible if you feel like it hashtag yolo.

 # Using Github
 
 If you click the Issues page at the top you will see all of the stuff left to do.  I have only added one issue related to what you would be doing, it's the one at the very top that says "Find Resource Images."  If you click on it there is a list of stuff that needs to be found.  You can use the website Pixabay, which is all royalty/copyright free pictures.  The less attractive the better.  Alternatively we can do some stuff in MS Paint.  Whatevs.  
 
 If you click the Projects tab you will find all of the projects that need to be done.  The top one says comicSans.  This is your board that you can add issues, notes, whatever you want to.  If you want to see how it works click on mine called Landing Page.  
 
 The WIKI has all of the information that I used to come up with this stupid idea, it's a quick read.  You can include whatever you want or don't want.  
 
 Finally, the code page (or the one that you started on) is where all of the code lives.  If you click on the folder called Pages you will see all of the pages that this website contains.  the comicSans ones are contained within their own folder!  Any images that you find can be contained in their own folder within the images folder!  
 
 Github can be a little difficult to use at first, but you are smart and can definitely figure it out! If you have questions ask me!  You can also look it up on youtube, there are TON of videos on how to use it.  Don't hesitate to ask me though :)  
 
 Oh and the link for the website is at the very top of the page you are viewing this on.
